# Product Context: ToDo Application

## Problem Statement
People often struggle to keep track of their tasks and responsibilities. Without a system to manage these tasks, important items can be forgotten, deadlines missed, and productivity reduced. A simple ToDo application provides an accessible solution to this common problem.

## User Needs
1. **Organization:** Users need a centralized place to record and track their tasks
2. **Status Tracking:** Users need to distinguish between pending and completed tasks
3. **Task Management:** Users need to add new tasks and remove completed or irrelevant ones
4. **Simplicity:** Users need an intuitive interface that doesn't require training or complex setup

## Solution
The ToDo application addresses these needs by providing:
- A clean, straightforward interface for managing tasks
- The ability to create, view, complete, and delete tasks
- Visual indicators for task status (open, in progress, completed, cancelled)
- Persistent storage so tasks remain available between sessions

## User Experience Goals
1. **Effortless Task Creation:** Adding a new task should be quick and require minimal input
2. **Clear Status Visualization:** Task status should be immediately apparent through visual cues
3. **Responsive Design:** The application should work well on various screen sizes
4. **Immediate Feedback:** Actions like completing or deleting tasks should provide visual confirmation
5. **Minimal Cognitive Load:** The interface should be intuitive with no unnecessary complexity

## Target Users
This application is designed for:
- Individual users managing personal tasks
- Users who need a simple, no-frills task management solution
- Users who prefer web-based applications over native applications

## User Workflows

### Adding a Task
1. User enters task description in the input field
2. User clicks "Add Task" button or presses Enter
3. System adds the task with "OPEN" status
4. Task appears in the list with appropriate styling

### Completing a Task
1. User identifies a task they've completed
2. User clicks the "Complete" button for that task
3. System updates the task status to "COMPLETED"
4. Task appearance changes to indicate completion (strikethrough text, color change)

### Deleting a Task
1. User identifies a task they want to remove
2. User clicks the "Delete" button for that task
3. System confirms the deletion action
4. System removes the task from the list

## Success Metrics
The application will be successful if users can:
1. Reliably create and manage their tasks
2. Clearly distinguish between completed and pending tasks
3. Navigate and use the interface without confusion
4. Access their tasks consistently across sessions
